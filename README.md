# nf-lra: nextflow long-read assembly pipeline




This folder contains scripts for generating and evaluating assemblies of genomes using long-read Oxford Nanpore sequencing. It uses the data flow programming language _nextflow_ to coordinate the steps in the pipeline, which involves:
- Automated QC of long-read genomic sequences (and Illumina reads for polishing)
- Assessment of contamination
- _De novo_ or reference-guided assembly with different assemblers and parameters
- Automated assessment of the assembly

## Installation
Docker, singularity, etc.

## Use
nextflow run [pipeline.nf]

## Something Something
